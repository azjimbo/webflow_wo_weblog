This is something I've been playing with for a while.  I noticed that there were flows to my web server that didn't appear in my web logs.  
I exepct this is somesort of vulnerability scanning and thought I should keep an eye on it.  
This weekend I added the avg bytes per packet to see if there was any real data being exchanged.  (not that I can tell so far :) )

next, I'll likely add this to my block list so that appearance on this list will result in being blocked by my firewall for 30 days.

You'll need to set up your internal IP space as well as your web server IPs.  I've included comments where they go.

Happy Hunting -
